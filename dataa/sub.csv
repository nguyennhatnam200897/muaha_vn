00:00:00.800,00:00:03.600,Hello everyone. Today I'm
00:00:03.600,00:00:06.000,"going to talk about something important,"
00:00:06.560,00:00:08.960,how you can speak English
00:00:08.960,00:00:11.040,better than ever before.
00:00:12.000,00:00:14.520,"If you've ever felt stuck, like no matter"
00:00:14.520,00:00:17.360,"how much you study, speaking still"
00:00:17.360,00:00:20.160,"feels hard, you're not alone."
00:00:20.880,00:00:23.200,So many learners feel the same way.
00:00:24.000,00:00:26.240,But here's the good news. You can
00:00:26.240,00:00:28.640,improve and it doesn't have to take
00:00:28.640,00:00:31.560,"years. In fact, with"
00:00:31.560,00:00:34.080,"the right techniques, you can start"
00:00:34.080,00:00:36.080,speaking better right away.
00:00:37.920,00:00:40.560,"Chapter one, the start of the"
00:00:40.560,00:00:43.480,journey. Have you
00:00:43.480,00:00:46.200,ever wondered what separates fluent
00:00:46.200,00:00:49.040,speakers from beginners?It's
00:00:49.040,00:00:51.520,not that fluent speakers know all the
00:00:51.520,00:00:54.240,words or never make mistakes.
00:00:54.800,00:00:57.280,"In fact, they make mistakes all the"
00:00:57.280,00:00:59.920,time. The real
00:00:59.920,00:01:02.800,difference is confidence. Fluent
00:01:02.800,00:01:05.040,speakers are confident in their ability
00:01:05.040,00:01:07.880,"to communicate, even when they don't"
00:01:07.880,00:01:10.560,know every word or grammar rule.
00:01:11.360,00:01:13.360,They don't freeze when they forget a
00:01:13.360,00:01:16.280,"word. They keep going, and"
00:01:16.280,00:01:18.960,that's what makes them sound fluent.
00:01:20.000,00:01:22.760,Imagine this. You're in a
00:01:22.760,00:01:25.680,conversation and the words just
00:01:25.680,00:01:28.120,flow. You're not thinking about
00:01:28.120,00:01:30.640,grammar. You're not hesitating.
00:01:31.120,00:01:34.000,You're just speaking. That's the goal.
00:01:34.960,00:01:37.800,But how do you get there?Let me
00:01:37.800,00:01:40.000,share something that might surprise you.
00:01:41.040,00:01:43.760,Small changes in how you practice can
00:01:43.760,00:01:45.760,make a huge difference.
00:01:47.280,00:01:49.120,You don't have to completely change your
00:01:49.120,00:01:51.760,study routine. You don't need to learn
00:01:51.840,00:01:54.480,thousands of new words. What you
00:01:54.480,00:01:57.280,need are a few simple techniques. That
00:01:57.280,00:01:59.600,will help you speak with confidence.
00:02:00.480,00:02:03.360,So what's the first step?
00:02:04.240,00:02:06.800,It's building the foundation of
00:02:06.800,00:02:09.520,"fluency, and that starts with"
00:02:09.520,00:02:12.240,confidence. If you don't feel
00:02:12.240,00:02:14.960,"confident, it's hard to speak well."
00:02:15.600,00:02:17.680,But confidence isn't something you're
00:02:17.680,00:02:20.040,born with. It's something you
00:02:20.040,00:02:22.640,"build, and I'm going to show you"
00:02:22.640,00:02:25.200,how. Here's the truth.
00:02:26.080,00:02:28.240,Anyone can speak better than they did
00:02:28.240,00:02:30.880,"before, no matter their current"
00:02:30.880,00:02:33.720,level. If you've struggled
00:02:33.720,00:02:36.160,"with English, or if you've been afraid to"
00:02:36.160,00:02:38.960,"speak, this podcast is for"
00:02:38.960,00:02:41.760,"you. We'll go step by step,"
00:02:41.920,00:02:44.800,breaking down the process into easy
00:02:44.800,00:02:47.120,techniques that you can start using
00:02:47.120,00:02:50.000,"today, and by the end, you'll"
00:02:50.000,00:02:52.640,be speaking English more confidently than
00:02:52.640,00:02:55.360,ever before. But before we
00:02:55.360,00:02:58.080,"dive into the techniques, let's talk"
00:02:58.080,00:03:00.880,about why confidence matters
00:03:00.880,00:03:01.680,so much.
00:03:03.760,00:03:06.240,"When you're confident, you're not"
00:03:06.240,00:03:08.480,afraid to make mistakes.
00:03:09.120,00:03:12.080,"You speak freely, and even when"
00:03:12.080,00:03:14.400,"you mess up, you learn from it."
00:03:15.360,00:03:18.080,"Every time you practice speaking, you're"
00:03:18.080,00:03:20.560,building not just your language
00:03:20.560,00:03:23.440,"skills, but also your confidence."
00:03:24.560,00:03:26.880,Here's a quote that I love from Winston
00:03:26.880,00:03:27.520,Churchill.
00:03:29.040,00:03:31.360,Success is not final.
00:03:31.840,00:03:34.800,Failure is not fatal. It is
00:03:34.800,00:03:37.680,the courage to continue that counts.
00:03:39.360,00:03:41.640,This is especially true when it comes to
00:03:41.640,00:03:44.080,speaking English. The more you
00:03:44.080,00:03:46.560,"speak, the more confident you become,"
00:03:46.800,00:03:49.200,and the more your fluency improves.
00:03:50.560,00:03:53.320,Now I know what you're thinking. But
00:03:53.320,00:03:55.760,what if I don't feel confident yet?
00:03:56.960,00:03:59.440,"Don't worry, that's totally"
00:03:59.440,00:04:02.400,normal. Confidence comes from
00:04:02.400,00:04:05.040,"doing. The more you speak,"
00:04:05.360,00:04:07.680,the better you'll get and the more
00:04:07.680,00:04:10.481,confident you'll feel. Let me
00:04:10.481,00:04:12.481,give you a small challenge to get
00:04:12.481,00:04:15.121,started. Set a goal to speak
00:04:15.121,00:04:17.681,"English every day, even if it's"
00:04:17.680,00:04:20.400,just for 5 minutes. You can
00:04:20.401,00:04:23.201,practice with a friend. Family member
00:04:23.201,00:04:26.161,or even by yourself. The key is
00:04:26.161,00:04:28.881,"to start speaking, even if it feels"
00:04:28.881,00:04:30.561,uncomfortable at first.
00:04:31.681,00:04:34.361,"Over the next chapters, we're going to"
00:04:34.401,00:04:36.961,breakdown exactly how you can build
00:04:36.961,00:04:39.601,confidence and improve your speaking.
00:04:40.321,00:04:42.401,"We'll cover listening techniques,"
00:04:42.641,00:04:45.441,"shadowing, repetition, and"
00:04:45.441,00:04:47.841,even some fun ways to practice.
00:04:48.641,00:04:51.441,And remember. It's not about being
00:04:51.441,00:04:54.241,"perfect, it's about making progress."
00:04:54.561,00:04:56.721,But there's a technique that will really
00:04:56.721,00:04:59.521,help you take the first big step toward
00:04:59.521,00:05:02.001,fluency. It's something that most
00:05:02.001,00:05:04.521,"learners overlook, but it's the"
00:05:04.521,00:05:07.201,secret to improving faster than you
00:05:07.201,00:05:07.761,think.
00:05:09.921,00:05:12.801,"Chapter 2, The Power of"
00:05:12.801,00:05:15.761,Active Listening. Now that we've
00:05:15.761,00:05:18.561,talked about building confidence. Let's
00:05:18.561,00:05:21.521,dive into the first key technique that
00:05:21.521,00:05:23.921,will truly help you speak better.
00:05:24.561,00:05:27.121,Active listening. You might think that
00:05:27.121,00:05:29.601,"speaking fluently is all about talking,"
00:05:30.081,00:05:32.721,but here's the truth. You can't
00:05:32.721,00:05:35.361,speak well unless you listen
00:05:35.361,00:05:37.841,well. Listening is the
00:05:37.841,00:05:39.521,foundation of fluency.
00:05:41.121,00:05:43.921,"Think about this. When you listen,"
00:05:44.081,00:05:46.881,you're not just hearing words. You're
00:05:46.881,00:05:49.521,"learning how sentences flow, how"
00:05:49.521,00:05:52.081,"native speakers connect ideas,"
00:05:52.401,00:05:55.121,and how certain words are pronounced.
00:05:55.921,00:05:58.401,"When you master listening, you'll find"
00:05:58.401,00:06:01.161,that speaking becomes easier and
00:06:01.161,00:06:03.761,more natural. It's like
00:06:03.921,00:06:06.481,filling your brain with the right tools
00:06:06.481,00:06:08.241,before you start building.
00:06:09.441,00:06:11.921,But not just any listening will do.
00:06:12.721,00:06:15.361,You need to practice active
00:06:15.361,00:06:18.161,listening. This means really
00:06:18.161,00:06:20.321,paying attention to what you hear.
00:06:21.201,00:06:23.841,You don't just let the words pass by.
00:06:24.321,00:06:26.881,"You focus on them, break them"
00:06:26.881,00:06:29.681,"down, and absorb how they're used."
00:06:30.561,00:06:33.361,Here's an example. When you're
00:06:33.361,00:06:36.161,"listening to a podcast, a story,"
00:06:36.401,00:06:38.801,"or even a conversation, pay"
00:06:38.801,00:06:40.801,attention to how the speaker is
00:06:40.801,00:06:42.721,structuring their sentences.
00:06:43.761,00:06:46.481,Are they using short phrases or long
00:06:46.481,00:06:49.401,sentences?How do they pronounce
00:06:49.401,00:06:52.321,certain words?How do they express their
00:06:52.321,00:06:53.281,ideas?
00:06:54.961,00:06:57.761,Active listening means noticing these
00:06:57.761,00:07:00.321,details and learning from them.
00:07:02.001,00:07:04.561,One of the best ways to practice active
00:07:04.561,00:07:06.561,listening is through shadowing.
00:07:08.081,00:07:10.881,Shadowing is a technique where you listen
00:07:10.881,00:07:13.841,to a speaker and immediately repeat what
00:07:13.841,00:07:16.481,they say. It's like being their
00:07:16.481,00:07:18.961,"shadow, following their words as"
00:07:18.961,00:07:20.561,closely as you can.
00:07:21.921,00:07:24.721,This is a powerful way to improve both
00:07:24.721,00:07:27.041,your listening and speaking at the same
00:07:27.041,00:07:29.841,time. Here's how
00:07:29.841,00:07:32.801,"you can practice shadowing. One,"
00:07:32.961,00:07:35.521,choose a podcast or story.
00:07:36.401,00:07:38.881,Pick something that's not too long or
00:07:38.881,00:07:41.801,difficult. You can find great stories and
00:07:41.801,00:07:44.281,podcasts for beginners on my YouTube
00:07:44.281,00:07:46.641,channel. 2
00:07:46.721,00:07:49.441,Listen carefully. Start by
00:07:49.441,00:07:51.921,listening to a short sentence or
00:07:51.921,00:07:54.561,phrase. Pay attention to the
00:07:54.561,00:07:56.961,"speaker's rhythm, tone, and"
00:07:56.961,00:07:59.121,"pronunciation. Three,"
00:07:59.601,00:08:02.481,pause and repeat. As soon
00:08:02.521,00:08:05.441,as the speaker finishes a sentence. Pause
00:08:05.441,00:08:08.161,"the audio and repeat what they said,"
00:08:08.561,00:08:10.801,trying to match their speed and
00:08:10.801,00:08:13.201,intonation 4.
00:08:13.761,00:08:16.721,Keep going. Repeat this
00:08:16.721,00:08:19.441,process for a few minutes each day.
00:08:20.001,00:08:22.241,You'll notice that your pronunciation and
00:08:22.241,00:08:24.801,fluency improve overtime.
00:08:25.841,00:08:28.561,Shadowing helps you get used to speaking
00:08:28.561,00:08:31.321,without overthinking. You're not
00:08:31.321,00:08:33.921,translating in your head. You're
00:08:33.921,00:08:36.401,"simply repeating what you hear,"
00:08:36.881,00:08:39.441,and this builds fluency naturally.
00:08:40.400,00:08:42.400,But let me tell you something important.
00:08:43.601,00:08:46.001,Don't worry about being perfect.
00:08:47.241,00:08:49.801,"When you're shadowing, you're going to"
00:08:49.841,00:08:52.801,make mistakes. Maybe you'll miss
00:08:52.801,00:08:55.121,a word or pronounce something wrong.
00:08:55.921,00:08:58.881,That's OK. The goal is not
00:08:58.881,00:09:01.721,perfection. The goal is to get
00:09:01.721,00:09:04.561,comfortable speaking without hesitation.
00:09:05.201,00:09:07.681,"The more you shadow, the more"
00:09:07.681,00:09:09.121,fluent you'll become.
00:09:10.481,00:09:13.041,"One of my students, Sarah, was really"
00:09:13.041,00:09:16.001,shy about speaking English. She
00:09:16.001,00:09:18.961,"was afraid of making mistakes, so"
00:09:18.961,00:09:21.441,she rarely spoke at all. I
00:09:21.441,00:09:23.841,"introduced her to shadowing, and it"
00:09:23.841,00:09:25.681,changed everything for her.
00:09:26.641,00:09:28.961,She started practicing by repeating
00:09:28.961,00:09:31.121,sentences from podcasts.
00:09:31.841,00:09:34.641,"At first, she struggled, but after a"
00:09:34.641,00:09:37.561,"few weeks, she noticed that her sentences"
00:09:37.561,00:09:40.321,flowed more easily. Shadowing
00:09:40.321,00:09:42.961,"helped her build confidence, and soon she"
00:09:42.961,00:09:44.641,was speaking without fear.
00:09:45.841,00:09:48.641,Here's a great quote by Steven Arvey that
00:09:48.641,00:09:50.321,fits perfectly here.
00:09:51.281,00:09:53.961,Most people do not listen with the
00:09:53.961,00:09:56.561,intent to understand. They
00:09:56.561,00:09:59.121,listen with the intent to reply.
00:10:00.561,00:10:03.001,Active listening teaches you to
00:10:03.041,00:10:05.921,"truly understand, and when"
00:10:05.921,00:10:08.561,"you understand, speaking becomes"
00:10:08.561,00:10:11.361,easier. But here's where things
00:10:11.361,00:10:13.801,get interesting. Active listening and
00:10:13.801,00:10:16.161,shadowing are just the beginning.
00:10:17.041,00:10:19.281,There's another technique that will help
00:10:19.281,00:10:21.601,"you take your fluency even further,"
00:10:22.081,00:10:24.801,and it's all about repetition.
00:10:25.921,00:10:28.561,"In the next chapter, I'll show you how"
00:10:28.561,00:10:31.201,repeating what you hear can make
00:10:31.201,00:10:33.281,speaking English feel as
00:10:33.281,00:10:35.361,natural as breathing.
00:10:37.281,00:10:39.921,"Chapter 3, the repetition"
00:10:39.921,00:10:42.401,technique. We've already
00:10:42.401,00:10:45.281,discussed the power of active listening
00:10:45.281,00:10:47.361,and shadowing. Now
00:10:47.921,00:10:50.361,let's move to a technique that may sound
00:10:50.361,00:10:52.641,simple but is incredibly
00:10:52.641,00:10:55.521,effective repetition.
00:10:56.801,00:10:59.681,"You might wonder, why is repeating"
00:10:59.681,00:11:02.361,things so important?The
00:11:02.361,00:11:05.121,answer is repetition is how your
00:11:05.121,00:11:07.921,brain learns to speak fluently without
00:11:07.921,00:11:10.641,hesitation. Think of it like
00:11:10.641,00:11:13.601,this. When you repeat words
00:11:13.601,00:11:16.561,"and phrases, you're training your brain"
00:11:16.561,00:11:19.521,to remember them quickly the more
00:11:19.521,00:11:22.321,you repeat. The more natural the words
00:11:22.321,00:11:24.841,"feel, and eventually you'll be able to"
00:11:24.841,00:11:26.801,say them without thinking.
00:11:27.841,00:11:30.001,It's like when you learn to ride a bike
00:11:30.001,00:11:32.961,or memorize a song. You did it
00:11:32.961,00:11:35.521,over and over until it became second
00:11:35.521,00:11:38.081,nature. Speaking
00:11:38.081,00:11:40.161,English is no different.
00:11:40.961,00:11:42.401,Here's something interesting.
00:11:43.201,00:11:46.161,Fluency isn't just about knowing a lot
00:11:46.161,00:11:48.801,of words. It's about being
00:11:48.801,00:11:51.601,able to use the words you know
00:11:51.841,00:11:53.921,quickly and easily.
00:11:54.801,00:11:57.361,Repetition helps you get to that point
00:11:57.681,00:11:59.921,where you don't have to stop and think
00:11:59.921,00:12:02.881,about grammar or vocabulary.
00:12:03.761,00:12:06.481,You just speak. Let me
00:12:06.481,00:12:08.641,"share a story about one of my students,"
00:12:08.641,00:12:11.521,Paul. Paul knew a lot of English
00:12:11.521,00:12:14.241,"words, but he often hesitated when"
00:12:14.241,00:12:17.081,speaking. because he had to think about
00:12:17.081,00:12:20.001,what to say. I introduced
00:12:20.001,00:12:22.081,him to the repetition technique.
00:12:22.721,00:12:25.362,"Every day, Paul would take five common"
00:12:25.362,00:12:28.082,phrases in English and repeat each
00:12:28.082,00:12:31.042,one five times. It seemed
00:12:31.042,00:12:33.762,"boring at first, but after a week,"
00:12:34.162,00:12:37.122,Paul noticed something amazing. He
00:12:37.122,00:12:39.882,could say those phrases easily and
00:12:39.882,00:12:41.202,without hesitation.
00:12:42.402,00:12:45.042,Repetition had worked its magic.
00:12:46.322,00:12:48.562,So how can you use
00:12:48.562,00:12:51.122,repetition to improve your speaking?
00:12:51.922,00:12:54.802,Let's break it down. One
00:12:54.962,00:12:57.922,repeat common phrases. Start by
00:12:57.922,00:13:00.722,"picking phrases you use often, like"
00:13:01.042,00:13:03.762,how are you?Or what's your name?
00:13:04.402,00:13:07.202,Repeat these phrases out loud multiple
00:13:07.202,00:13:09.842,times. This helps your brain get
00:13:09.842,00:13:12.802,used to saying them quickly. You can
00:13:12.802,00:13:15.602,"do this while walking, cooking, or"
00:13:15.602,00:13:18.402,even in front of a mirror. The goal
00:13:18.402,00:13:21.202,is to make these phrases feel natural
00:13:22.162,00:13:24.402,to use the mirror
00:13:24.402,00:13:26.722,technique. The mirror
00:13:26.722,00:13:29.522,technique is a great way to practice
00:13:29.522,00:13:32.242,repetition. Stand in front of a
00:13:32.242,00:13:34.962,mirror and say the same sentence
00:13:34.962,00:13:37.522,five times. Watch your mouth
00:13:37.522,00:13:39.522,move. Focus on your
00:13:39.522,00:13:42.242,pronunciation. And get used to seeing
00:13:42.242,00:13:45.042,yourself speak English. This
00:13:45.042,00:13:47.762,"technique not only improves your fluency,"
00:13:47.762,00:13:50.642,but also builds confidence because it's
00:13:50.642,00:13:53.202,like practicing with someone else.
00:13:54.322,00:13:56.882,3 shadowing plus
00:13:56.882,00:13:59.762,repetition. Remember
00:13:59.762,00:14:01.602,shadowing from Chapter 2?
00:14:03.042,00:14:05.762,You can combine shadowing with
00:14:05.762,00:14:08.562,repetition for double the impact.
00:14:09.882,00:14:12.402,"When you shadow a podcast or story,"
00:14:12.722,00:14:15.482,repeat the sentences as closely as you
00:14:15.482,00:14:17.842,can to the original speaker.
00:14:18.562,00:14:20.962,"Then, after you've shadowed a few"
00:14:20.962,00:14:23.762,"sentences, repeat those sentences again"
00:14:23.762,00:14:26.242,on your own. This is where the
00:14:26.242,00:14:29.042,power of repetition really shines.
00:14:29.042,00:14:31.442,It turns what you hear into what you can
00:14:31.442,00:14:33.922,easily say. A
00:14:33.922,00:14:36.402,quote by Aristotle explains this
00:14:36.402,00:14:39.362,perfectly. We are what we
00:14:39.362,00:14:40.722,repeatedly do.
00:14:41.842,00:14:44.402,"Excellence, then, is not an"
00:14:44.402,00:14:46.082,"act, but a habit."
00:14:47.282,00:14:49.882,"Repeating phrases, sentences, and"
00:14:49.882,00:14:52.802,words turns speaking English into a
00:14:52.802,00:14:55.762,"habit, and that habit is what"
00:14:55.762,00:14:57.122,leads to fluency.
00:14:59.842,00:15:02.082,4 Record yourself.
00:15:02.882,00:15:05.522,One more way to practice repetition
00:15:05.682,00:15:08.642,is by recording yourself. Choose
00:15:08.642,00:15:11.362,a short passage from a podcast or a
00:15:11.362,00:15:14.322,story. You can find plenty of stories
00:15:14.322,00:15:16.962,on my YouTube channel. Read it
00:15:16.962,00:15:19.602,"aloud, record yourself speaking,"
00:15:19.922,00:15:22.722,then listen to the recording and repeat
00:15:22.722,00:15:25.442,the sentences again. This not
00:15:25.442,00:15:28.242,"only helps with fluency, but also"
00:15:28.242,00:15:30.362,lets you hear your own progress over
00:15:30.362,00:15:33.282,time. You'll notice that you sound
00:15:33.282,00:15:34.962,more natural and fluent
00:15:36.002,00:15:38.562,"5. Small steps,"
00:15:38.722,00:15:41.682,big progress. You don't have
00:15:41.682,00:15:44.162,to repeat long paragraphs or difficult
00:15:44.162,00:15:46.482,phrases. Start small.
00:15:46.882,00:15:49.842,Pick simple sentences like I'm going
00:15:49.842,00:15:52.402,to the store. I like reading books
00:15:52.722,00:15:55.442,or can you help me?And practice them
00:15:55.442,00:15:58.402,"daily. Small, consistent practice"
00:15:58.402,00:16:00.562,will lead to big improvements in your
00:16:00.562,00:16:01.442,fluency.
00:16:03.522,00:16:05.602,One thing to remember. Is that
00:16:05.602,00:16:08.162,repetition doesn't mean being
00:16:08.162,00:16:11.122,"boring. Yes, you're repeating"
00:16:11.122,00:16:14.002,"the same phrases, but you can mix it up"
00:16:14.002,00:16:16.922,by using different contexts. For
00:16:16.922,00:16:19.682,"example, practice the same"
00:16:19.682,00:16:22.482,"sentence in the morning, then again in"
00:16:22.482,00:16:25.202,"the evening, but this"
00:16:25.202,00:16:27.522,time pretend you're in a different
00:16:27.522,00:16:30.402,"situation, maybe talking to a"
00:16:30.402,00:16:33.362,friend or ordering food at a restaurant.
00:16:34.562,00:16:37.042,There's another reason repetition is so
00:16:37.042,00:16:39.602,powerful. It helps you build
00:16:39.602,00:16:42.562,confidence. The more
00:16:42.562,00:16:44.802,"you repeat something, the more"
00:16:44.802,00:16:47.122,comfortable you feel saying it.
00:16:47.842,00:16:50.082,"And when you're comfortable, you"
00:16:50.082,00:16:52.162,speak without fear.
00:16:53.122,00:16:55.682,The hesitation disappears and your
00:16:55.682,00:16:58.162,words start to flow naturally.
00:17:00.242,00:17:02.242,But here's the exciting part.
00:17:02.802,00:17:05.522,Repetition is just one piece of the
00:17:05.521,00:17:08.401,"puzzle. In the next chapter,"
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.882,we'll talk about how to make practice
00:17:10.882,00:17:13.682,fun. You'll learn how to turn
00:17:13.682,00:17:16.162,speaking English into something you look
00:17:16.162,00:17:19.122,forward to every day instead of
00:17:19.122,00:17:21.442,something that feels like hard work.
00:17:23.202,00:17:25.442,"Chapter 4, Making"
00:17:25.442,00:17:28.402,Practice Fun. Speaking
00:17:28.402,00:17:30.402,English doesn't have to feel like a
00:17:30.402,00:17:33.362,"chore. In fact, the"
00:17:33.362,00:17:36.322,"more fun you have while practicing, the"
00:17:36.322,00:17:38.002,faster you'll improve.
00:17:39.042,00:17:41.682,"When learning is enjoyable, you"
00:17:41.682,00:17:44.242,naturally want to do it more often.
00:17:45.202,00:17:48.162,This chapter is all about turning your
00:17:48.162,00:17:50.802,English practice into something you look
00:17:50.802,00:17:52.562,forward to every day.
00:17:54.202,00:17:57.042,Imagine this instead of forcing
00:17:57.042,00:17:59.842,yourself to sit down and study. You
00:17:59.922,00:18:02.642,actually enjoy speaking English.
00:18:03.922,00:18:06.522,It's not about studying grammar
00:18:06.522,00:18:09.042,rules or memorizing words.
00:18:09.442,00:18:12.402,It's about having fun and feeling
00:18:12.402,00:18:14.802,excited to use what you've learned.
00:18:15.682,00:18:17.682,But how do you make practice fun?
00:18:18.562,00:18:21.362,Let's explore a few techniques that will
00:18:21.362,00:18:24.001,turn your speaking practice. Into an
00:18:24.001,00:18:25.681,activity you love.
00:18:28.401,00:18:30.721,One role-playing
00:18:31.201,00:18:33.921,step into real conversations.
00:18:35.601,00:18:37.841,One of the best ways to make speaking
00:18:37.841,00:18:39.921,English fun is through
00:18:39.921,00:18:42.681,role-playing. This is where you
00:18:42.721,00:18:45.201,act out different situations as if you're
00:18:45.201,00:18:47.881,really there. You can pretend to
00:18:47.881,00:18:50.241,be ordering coffee at a
00:18:50.241,00:18:53.041,"cafe, having a job interview."
00:18:53.521,00:18:55.521,Meeting new friends at a party.
00:18:56.481,00:18:59.161,"By role-playing, you're practicing real"
00:18:59.161,00:19:01.841,"life conversations in a low pressure,"
00:19:02.161,00:19:05.041,enjoyable way. Here's how you
00:19:05.041,00:19:07.201,"can start. One,"
00:19:07.761,00:19:10.241,pick a situation. Think of a
00:19:10.241,00:19:12.481,common scenario where you might need to
00:19:12.481,00:19:15.041,"speak English, like asking for"
00:19:15.041,00:19:17.041,directions or ordering food.
00:19:18.241,00:19:20.561,"Two, create a dialogue."
00:19:21.601,00:19:24.161,Write down a few sentences that you might
00:19:24.161,00:19:26.321,need to say in that situation.
00:19:27.601,00:19:29.441,"Three, act it out."
00:19:30.321,00:19:33.121,Do this alone or with a friend.
00:19:33.841,00:19:36.361,Pretend you're in the actual place and
00:19:36.361,00:19:38.801,use the sentences you've prepared.
00:19:40.161,00:19:42.641,The great thing about role-playing is
00:19:42.641,00:19:45.041,that it helps you get comfortable with
00:19:45.121,00:19:47.841,everyday phrases and situations.
00:19:48.561,00:19:50.801,Plus it feels more like.
00:19:51.121,00:19:53.761,"Acting than studying, so it's"
00:19:53.761,00:19:55.361,much more enjoyable.
00:19:56.481,00:19:59.121,"One of my students, Anna, used to feel"
00:19:59.121,00:20:01.761,bored practicing English by
00:20:01.761,00:20:04.641,herself. I introduced
00:20:04.641,00:20:07.521,"her to role-playing, and suddenly her"
00:20:07.521,00:20:10.001,practice sessions became more
00:20:10.001,00:20:12.881,exciting. She would imagine
00:20:12.881,00:20:15.361,"herself traveling, ordering food,"
00:20:15.601,00:20:18.241,"and meeting new people, all while"
00:20:18.241,00:20:19.601,practicing English.
00:20:20.481,00:20:22.761,"Overtime, her speaking skills"
00:20:22.761,00:20:25.201,improved and she didn't even
00:20:25.201,00:20:26.881,realize she was studying.
00:20:29.361,00:20:32.241,"Two, talk about what you love."
00:20:33.361,00:20:36.161,Another way to make practice fun is
00:20:36.161,00:20:38.721,by talking about your passions.
00:20:39.521,00:20:42.122,"Think about something you love, whether"
00:20:42.122,00:20:44.642,"it's a hobby, a sport, a favorite"
00:20:44.642,00:20:47.362,"movie, or a book. When you talk about"
00:20:47.362,00:20:50.122,things that interest you. The words come
00:20:50.122,00:20:53.082,"more easily, and you're more motivated to"
00:20:53.082,00:20:56.002,"keep speaking. For example,"
00:20:56.402,00:20:59.202,"if you love cooking, try talking"
00:20:59.202,00:21:01.762,about your favorite recipes in English.
00:21:02.642,00:21:05.202,"Describe how to make your favorite dish,"
00:21:05.362,00:21:07.722,or pretend you're teaching someone how to
00:21:07.722,00:21:10.442,cook. The key is to
00:21:10.482,00:21:12.962,pick a topic that excites you
00:21:13.682,00:21:16.402,so you'll feel more engaged
00:21:16.402,00:21:19.122,while practicing. Here's a
00:21:19.122,00:21:21.442,great quote by Albert Einstein.
00:21:22.482,00:21:25.442,Creativity is intelligence having
00:21:25.442,00:21:28.282,fun. When you practice
00:21:28.282,00:21:30.722,"speaking about things you love, you're"
00:21:30.722,00:21:33.642,"using your creativity, and that"
00:21:33.642,00:21:36.362,makes the process more enjoyable and
00:21:36.362,00:21:37.202,effective.
00:21:39.602,00:21:42.082,3 Play
00:21:42.082,00:21:43.522,speaking games.
00:21:45.202,00:21:47.482,Who said language learning can't be a
00:21:47.482,00:21:50.322,game?There are lots of speaking games
00:21:50.322,00:21:52.962,you can play either by yourself or with a
00:21:52.962,00:21:55.442,partner. These games
00:21:55.442,00:21:57.922,challenge you to think and speak in
00:21:57.922,00:22:00.642,"English, but in a fun and lighthearted"
00:22:00.642,00:22:01.122,way.
00:22:03.682,00:22:05.922,4. Practice with
00:22:05.922,00:22:08.322,podcasts and stories.
00:22:09.122,00:22:12.082,Another way to keep practice fun is by
00:22:12.082,00:22:14.642,using podcasts and stories.
00:22:15.362,00:22:18.162,Listening to stories and podcasts
00:22:18.162,00:22:20.882,"not only improves your listening skills,"
00:22:21.202,00:22:23.762,but it also gives you great material to
00:22:23.762,00:22:26.722,talk about. After
00:22:26.722,00:22:29.682,"listening, try summarizing the story"
00:22:29.682,00:22:32.322,in your own words or discuss it with a
00:22:32.322,00:22:34.962,friend. You can find many
00:22:34.962,00:22:37.842,great stories and podcasts on my
00:22:37.842,00:22:40.402,"YouTube channel, designed to help"
00:22:40.402,00:22:42.882,learners like you improve their
00:22:42.882,00:22:45.762,English. Choose a topic
00:22:45.762,00:22:48.082,"that interests you, listen to the"
00:22:48.082,00:22:50.722,"story, and then practice speaking"
00:22:50.722,00:22:53.442,"about it. This way, you're"
00:22:53.442,00:22:56.082,learning from engaging content while
00:22:56.082,00:22:58.402,practicing your speaking skills.
00:23:01.282,00:23:03.602,"One of my students, Tom,"
00:23:03.922,00:23:06.362,struggled with staying motivated to
00:23:06.402,00:23:09.202,"practice speaking, but once he"
00:23:09.202,00:23:12.082,started listening to podcasts about his
00:23:12.082,00:23:15.002,favorite topics. Like technology and
00:23:15.002,00:23:17.842,"travel, he found that speaking about them"
00:23:17.842,00:23:20.722,came naturally. He would listen
00:23:20.722,00:23:23.602,"to an episode, then practice explaining"
00:23:23.602,00:23:26.402,"it to himself or others, making"
00:23:26.402,00:23:29.202,his practice both effective and
00:23:29.202,00:23:30.082,enjoyable.
00:23:33.922,00:23:35.522,Change your environment.
00:23:36.642,00:23:38.842,Sometimes a change in your
00:23:38.842,00:23:41.322,environment can make practice more
00:23:41.322,00:23:43.882,exciting. Instead of sitting at a
00:23:43.882,00:23:46.642,"desk, try practicing in different"
00:23:46.642,00:23:49.442,places. Go for a walk
00:23:49.682,00:23:52.082,and describe what you see in English.
00:23:53.042,00:23:56.002,Sit in a cafe and pretend you're having
00:23:56.002,00:23:57.922,a conversation with the barista.
00:23:58.802,00:24:01.362,The idea is to bring your practice into
00:24:01.362,00:24:04.282,the real world. By changing
00:24:04.282,00:24:06.802,"where you practice, you keep things"
00:24:06.802,00:24:09.602,fresh and interesting. Plus
00:24:09.922,00:24:12.402,practicing in real life environments.
00:24:12.642,00:24:14.642,Helps you get comfortable speaking
00:24:14.642,00:24:17.362,English in everyday situations.
00:24:19.842,00:24:22.002,6 Celebrate your
00:24:22.002,00:24:24.882,progress. Don't forget to
00:24:24.882,00:24:27.842,"celebrate your wins, no matter how"
00:24:27.842,00:24:30.482,small. Did you speak in
00:24:30.482,00:24:33.122,English for 5 minutes without stopping?
00:24:34.562,00:24:36.802,Did you successfully role play a
00:24:36.802,00:24:39.442,conversation?Celebrate
00:24:39.442,00:24:42.242,that. Recognizing your
00:24:42.242,00:24:44.642,progress is a great way to stay
00:24:44.642,00:24:47.042,motivated and keep practicing.
00:24:48.162,00:24:50.722,A famous quote by BF Skinner says
00:24:51.522,00:24:54.242,a person who feels appreciated will
00:24:54.242,00:24:56.882,always do more than what is expected.
00:24:57.602,00:25:00.002,This applies to yourself as well.
00:25:00.722,00:25:02.882,The more you appreciate your own
00:25:02.882,00:25:05.722,"progress, the more motivated you'll be to"
00:25:05.722,00:25:06.802,keep improving.
00:25:08.562,00:25:11.362,Now you might be thinking. This all
00:25:11.362,00:25:14.322,"sounds great, but what if I hit a wall?"
00:25:14.682,00:25:16.322,What if I feel stuck?
00:25:17.362,00:25:20.082,"Don't worry, that's completely normal."
00:25:20.642,00:25:23.122,"In the next chapter, we'll talk about"
00:25:23.122,00:25:25.682,breaking through those speaking blocks
00:25:26.002,00:25:28.242,and how to keep moving forward
00:25:28.642,00:25:30.722,even when it feels tough.
00:25:33.762,00:25:36.322,"Chapter 5, Breaking Through Speaking"
00:25:36.322,00:25:39.282,Blocks. So far you've learned how
00:25:39.282,00:25:41.362,to make English practice fun with
00:25:41.362,00:25:43.482,"role-playing, speaking games, and"
00:25:43.482,00:25:46.002,podcasts. But what
00:25:46.002,00:25:48.802,"happens when you feel stuck,"
00:25:49.322,00:25:52.042,when the words just don't come out and
00:25:52.042,00:25:54.562,you're afraid of making mistakes?
00:25:55.682,00:25:58.482,These speaking blocks are normal
00:25:58.962,00:26:01.682,and every learner experiences
00:26:01.682,00:26:04.562,them. The key
00:26:04.562,00:26:07.442,is to understand how to break through
00:26:07.442,00:26:10.402,them. Let's start
00:26:10.402,00:26:12.242,by recognizing one thing.
00:26:13.122,00:26:15.682,Making mistakes is part of the learning
00:26:15.682,00:26:18.482,process. One of the
00:26:18.482,00:26:21.122,biggest reasons people feel blocked is
00:26:21.122,00:26:23.202,the fear of saying something wrong.
00:26:24.002,00:26:26.522,But here's a secret. Even
00:26:26.522,00:26:29.042,native speakers make mistakes.
00:26:29.642,00:26:31.922,What matters is that you keep
00:26:31.922,00:26:34.762,speaking. The more you
00:26:34.762,00:26:37.682,"speak, the more confident you'll become,"
00:26:37.922,00:26:40.482,and the easier it will be to push through
00:26:40.482,00:26:43.362,those blocks. One
00:26:43.762,00:26:46.562,overcome the fear of mistakes.
00:26:47.562,00:26:50.202,Imagine you're having a conversation and
00:26:50.202,00:26:52.802,suddenly you forget a word
00:26:52.962,00:26:54.722,or say something wrong.
00:26:55.762,00:26:58.322,What do you do?Most
00:26:58.322,00:27:00.962,people freeze up or stop speaking
00:27:00.962,00:27:03.442,entirely. But here's what you should do
00:27:03.442,00:27:05.842,instead. Keep talking.
00:27:07.202,00:27:09.602,Don't worry about getting every word
00:27:09.602,00:27:11.922,right. Just focus on
00:27:11.922,00:27:13.682,communicating your message.
00:27:14.722,00:27:17.202,Describe the word in another way.
00:27:18.082,00:27:20.802,"If you can't remember a word, explain it"
00:27:20.802,00:27:22.482,using different words.
00:27:24.082,00:27:26.162,Stay in the conversation.
00:27:27.122,00:27:29.602,The important thing is to keep going.
00:27:30.802,00:27:33.282,"Let me tell you about one of my students,"
00:27:33.442,00:27:36.242,Daniel. He was so worried about
00:27:36.242,00:27:38.482,making mistakes that he would
00:27:38.642,00:27:41.602,freeze whenever he tried
00:27:41.602,00:27:44.482,to speak English. I told
00:27:44.482,00:27:46.722,him that mistakes are not
00:27:46.722,00:27:49.322,"failures, they're opportunities to"
00:27:49.322,00:27:51.842,learn. We worked on
00:27:51.842,00:27:54.162,building his confidence by
00:27:54.162,00:27:56.562,"practicing simple conversations,"
00:27:57.122,00:28:00.082,and I encouraged him to keep speaking.
00:28:00.562,00:28:02.722,Even when he wasn't sure of the right
00:28:02.722,00:28:05.682,"words overtime,"
00:28:06.162,00:28:09.122,"Daniel learned that the more he spoke,"
00:28:09.442,00:28:12.402,the more his confidence grew and the
00:28:12.402,00:28:14.962,less those mistakes bothered him.
00:28:15.922,00:28:18.562,There's a famous quote by Henry Ford that
00:28:18.562,00:28:21.442,says failure is simply the
00:28:21.442,00:28:24.082,"opportunity to begin again, this"
00:28:24.082,00:28:26.722,time more intelligently every
00:28:26.722,00:28:29.282,time you make a mistake. You're learning
00:28:29.282,00:28:31.842,how to speak better the next time
00:28:32.242,00:28:35.202,to use self talk to
00:28:35.202,00:28:38.082,breakthrough. When you don't
00:28:38.082,00:28:40.802,"have anyone to practice with, self"
00:28:40.802,00:28:43.242,talk can be your best
00:28:43.242,00:28:45.762,tool for breaking through speaking
00:28:45.762,00:28:48.562,blocks. This technique is
00:28:48.562,00:28:50.642,simple but powerful.
00:28:51.442,00:28:54.402,All you have to do is talk to yourself in
00:28:54.402,00:28:57.283,English out loud as if you're having a
00:28:57.283,00:29:00.243,conversation. You can do this while
00:29:00.243,00:29:02.323,doing daily tasks like
00:29:02.803,00:29:05.763,"cooking, walking, getting"
00:29:05.763,00:29:06.723,ready for bed.
00:29:08.403,00:29:10.803,Here's how self-talk works.
00:29:12.803,00:29:15.563,Describe your day. Talk about
00:29:15.563,00:29:18.323,"what you did today, where you went,"
00:29:18.403,00:29:20.483,or what you plan to do tomorrow.
00:29:21.283,00:29:23.443,Ask yourself questions.
00:29:24.163,00:29:27.123,"For example, what do I want to eat for"
00:29:27.123,00:29:30.083,dinner?Then answer in English.
00:29:31.843,00:29:33.763,Practice situations.
00:29:34.803,00:29:37.523,Imagine you're at a restaurant or
00:29:37.523,00:29:40.403,meeting someone new and practice what
00:29:40.403,00:29:43.283,"you would say. One of my students,"
00:29:43.283,00:29:46.243,"Sophie, felt blocked because she"
00:29:46.243,00:29:49.123,didn't have a speaking partner. I
00:29:49.123,00:29:51.923,introduced her to self-talk and she
00:29:51.923,00:29:54.643,started practicing English every
00:29:54.643,00:29:57.523,day while doing her morning routine.
00:29:58.643,00:30:01.603,"Over time, Sophie noticed that her"
00:30:01.603,00:30:04.563,confidence grew and speaking English
00:30:04.563,00:30:07.123,"felt more natural. Three,"
00:30:07.603,00:30:10.243,use shadowing to push through.
00:30:10.883,00:30:13.523,We've already talked about shadowing in
00:30:13.523,00:30:16.323,"previous chapters, but it's such an"
00:30:16.323,00:30:18.723,effective technique that it deserves a
00:30:18.723,00:30:21.283,"mention here, too. When you"
00:30:21.283,00:30:24.003,"feel stuck, shadowing can"
00:30:24.003,00:30:26.403,help you keep moving forward.
00:30:27.443,00:30:30.363,By listening to a podcast or story and
00:30:30.363,00:30:33.283,"repeating what the speaker says, you're"
00:30:33.283,00:30:36.243,practicing real conversation patterns
00:30:37.283,00:30:39.923,without the pressure of coming up with
00:30:39.923,00:30:42.763,your own sentences. Start
00:30:42.763,00:30:45.283,"with short, simple sentences"
00:30:46.003,00:30:48.323,and work your way up to longer
00:30:48.323,00:30:49.603,conversations.
00:30:50.803,00:30:53.443,Shadowing helps you build fluency
00:30:53.683,00:30:56.003,because you're practicing. Both
00:30:56.083,00:30:58.803,listening and speaking at the same time.
00:30:59.763,00:31:02.563,Plus it helps you breakthrough speaking
00:31:02.563,00:31:04.923,blocks by giving you the words and
00:31:04.923,00:31:07.043,phrases you need to keep talking.
00:31:09.123,00:31:11.723,"Remember, you can find"
00:31:11.723,00:31:14.283,plenty of stories and podcasts to
00:31:14.283,00:31:16.723,shadow on my YouTube channel.
00:31:17.683,00:31:20.163,These are great for practicing because
00:31:20.163,00:31:22.803,they're designed for beginners. And will
00:31:22.803,00:31:25.203,help you build fluency step by
00:31:25.203,00:31:25.843,step.
00:31:28.723,00:31:31.683,4 Role play challenging
00:31:31.683,00:31:33.043,situations.
00:31:34.803,00:31:37.203,Another great way to breakthrough
00:31:37.203,00:31:39.203,speaking blocks is by
00:31:39.203,00:31:41.123,role-playing difficult
00:31:41.123,00:31:43.843,conversations. Think
00:31:43.843,00:31:46.403,about the situations that make you feel
00:31:46.403,00:31:49.283,the most nervous. Maybe it's
00:31:49.763,00:31:52.723,giving directions. Having
00:31:52.723,00:31:55.683,a job interview. Talking
00:31:55.683,00:31:58.163,about a complicated topic.
00:31:59.203,00:32:01.363,Practice these situations with
00:32:01.363,00:32:03.923,role-playing until they become
00:32:04.083,00:32:06.483,easier. For
00:32:06.483,00:32:09.043,"example, if you're nervous about"
00:32:09.043,00:32:11.523,"giving a presentation in English,"
