{"result":"It's not that fluent speakers know all the words or never make mistakes.", "question": "Không phải người nói lưu loát nào cũng biết hết tất cả các từ hoặc không bao giờ mắc lỗi."},
{"result":"In fact, they make mistakes all the time.", "question": "Trên thực tế, họ luôn mắc lỗi."},
{"result":"The real difference is confidence.", "question": "Sự khác biệt thực sự là sự tự tin."},
{"result":"Fluent speakers are confident in their ability to communicate,", "question": "Người nói lưu loát tự tin vào khả năng giao tiếp của mình,"},
{"result":"even when they don't know every word or grammar rule.", "question": "ngay cả khi họ không biết mọi từ hoặc quy tắc ngữ pháp."},
{"result":"They don't freeze when they forget a word.", "question": "Họ không bối rối khi quên một từ nào đó."},
{"result":"They keep going, and that's what makes them sound fluent.", "question": "Họ cứ tiếp tục như vậy, và đó là lý do khiến họ nói trôi chảy."},
{"result":"Imagine this.", "question": "Hãy tưởng tượng điều này."},
{"result":"You're in a conversation and the words just flow.", "question": "Bạn đang trò chuyện và mọi lời nói cứ tuôn ra."},

{"result":"But there's a technique that will really help you take the first big step toward fluency.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's something that most learners overlook, but it's the secret to improving faster than you think.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Chapter 2, The Power of Active Listening.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Now that we've talked about building confidence.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let's dive into the first key technique that will truly help you speak better.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Active listening.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You might think that speaking fluently is all about talking, but here's the truth.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can't speak well unless you listen well.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Listening is the foundation of fluency.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Think about this.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you listen, you're not just hearing words.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You're learning how sentences flow, how native speakers connect ideas, and how certain words are pronounced.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you master listening, you'll find that speaking becomes easier and more natural.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's like filling your brain with the right tools before you start building.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But not just any listening will do.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You need to practice active listening.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This means really paying attention to what you hear.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You don't just let the words pass by.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You focus on them, break them down, and absorb how they're used.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's an example.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you're listening to a podcast, a story, or even a conversation, pay attention to how the speaker is structuring their sentences.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Are they using short phrases or long sentences?", "question": ""},
{"result":"How do they pronounce certain words?", "question": ""},
{"result":"How do they express their ideas?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Active listening means noticing these details and learning from them.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of the best ways to practice active listening is through shadowing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Shadowing is a technique where you listen to a speaker and immediately repeat what they say.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's like being their shadow, following their words as closely as you can.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This is a powerful way to improve both your listening and speaking at the same time.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's how you can practice shadowing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One, choose a podcast or story.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Pick something that's not too long or difficult.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can find great stories and podcasts for beginners on my YouTube channel.", "question": ""},
{"result":"2 Listen carefully.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Start by listening to a short sentence or phrase.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Pay attention to the speaker's rhythm, tone, and pronunciation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Three, pause and repeat.", "question": ""},
{"result":"As soon as the speaker finishes a sentence.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Pause the audio and repeat what they said, trying to match their speed and intonation 4.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Keep going.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repeat this process for a few minutes each day.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You'll notice that your pronunciation and fluency improve overtime.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Shadowing helps you get used to speaking without overthinking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You're not translating in your head.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You're simply repeating what you hear, and this builds fluency naturally.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But let me tell you something important.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Don't worry about being perfect.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you're shadowing, you're going to make mistakes.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Maybe you'll miss a word or pronounce something wrong.", "question": ""},
{"result":"That's OK.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The goal is not perfection.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The goal is to get comfortable speaking without hesitation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The more you shadow, the more fluent you'll become.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of my students, Sarah, was really shy about speaking English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"She was afraid of making mistakes, so she rarely spoke at all.", "question": ""},
{"result":"I introduced her to shadowing, and it changed everything for her.", "question": ""},
{"result":"She started practicing by repeating sentences from podcasts.", "question": ""},
{"result":"At first, she struggled, but after a few weeks, she noticed that her sentences flowed more easily.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Shadowing helped her build confidence, and soon she was speaking without fear.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's a great quote by Steven Arvey that fits perfectly here.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand.", "question": ""},
{"result":"They listen with the intent to reply.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Active listening teaches you to truly understand, and when you understand, speaking becomes easier.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But here's where things get interesting.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Active listening and shadowing are just the beginning.", "question": ""},
{"result":"There's another technique that will help you take your fluency even further, and it's all about repetition.", "question": ""},
{"result":"In the next chapter, I'll show you how repeating what you hear can make speaking English feel as natural as breathing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Chapter 3, the repetition technique.", "question": ""},
{"result":"We've already discussed the power of active listening and shadowing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Now let's move to a technique that may sound simple but is incredibly effective repetition.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You might wonder, why is repeating things so important?", "question": ""},
{"result":"The answer is repetition is how your brain learns to speak fluently without hesitation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Think of it like this.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you repeat words and phrases, you're training your brain to remember them quickly the more you repeat.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The more natural the words feel, and eventually you'll be able to say them without thinking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's like when you learn to ride a bike or memorize a song.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You did it over and over until it became second nature.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Speaking English is no different.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's something interesting.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Fluency isn't just about knowing a lot of words.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's about being able to use the words you know quickly and easily.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repetition helps you get to that point where you don't have to stop and think about grammar or vocabulary.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You just speak.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let me share a story about one of my students, Paul.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Paul knew a lot of English words, but he often hesitated when speaking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"because he had to think about what to say.", "question": ""},
{"result":"I introduced him to the repetition technique.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Every day, Paul would take five common phrases in English and repeat each one five times.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It seemed boring at first, but after a week, Paul noticed something amazing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"He could say those phrases easily and without hesitation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repetition had worked its magic.", "question": ""},
{"result":"So how can you use repetition to improve your speaking?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let's break it down.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One repeat common phrases.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Start by picking phrases you use often, like how are you?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Or what's your name?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repeat these phrases out loud multiple times.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This helps your brain get used to saying them quickly.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can do this while walking, cooking, or even in front of a mirror.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The goal is to make these phrases feel natural to use the mirror technique.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The mirror technique is a great way to practice repetition.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Stand in front of a mirror and say the same sentence five times.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Watch your mouth move.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Focus on your pronunciation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"And get used to seeing yourself speak English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This technique not only improves your fluency, but also builds confidence because it's like practicing with someone else.", "question": ""},
{"result":"3 shadowing plus repetition.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Remember shadowing from Chapter 2?", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can combine shadowing with repetition for double the impact.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you shadow a podcast or story, repeat the sentences as closely as you can to the original speaker.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Then, after you've shadowed a few sentences, repeat those sentences again on your own.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This is where the power of repetition really shines.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It turns what you hear into what you can easily say.", "question": ""},
{"result":"A quote by Aristotle explains this perfectly.", "question": ""},
{"result":"We are what we repeatedly do.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repeating phrases, sentences, and words turns speaking English into a habit, and that habit is what leads to fluency.", "question": ""},
{"result":"4 Record yourself.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One more way to practice repetition is by recording yourself.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Choose a short passage from a podcast or a story.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can find plenty of stories on my YouTube channel.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Read it aloud, record yourself speaking, then listen to the recording and repeat the sentences again.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This not only helps with fluency, but also lets you hear your own progress over time.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You'll notice that you sound more natural and fluent 5.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Small steps, big progress.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You don't have to repeat long paragraphs or difficult phrases.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Start small.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Pick simple sentences like I'm going to the store.", "question": ""},
{"result":"I like reading books or can you help me?", "question": ""},
{"result":"And practice them daily.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Small, consistent practice will lead to big improvements in your fluency.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One thing to remember.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Is that repetition doesn't mean being boring.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Yes, you're repeating the same phrases, but you can mix it up by using different contexts.", "question": ""},
{"result":"For example, practice the same sentence in the morning, then again in the evening,", "question": ""},
{"result":"but this time pretend you're in a different situation, maybe talking to a friend or ordering food at a restaurant.", "question": ""},
{"result":"There's another reason repetition is so powerful.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It helps you build confidence.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The more you repeat something, the more comfortable you feel saying it.", "question": ""},
{"result":"And when you're comfortable, you speak without fear.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The hesitation disappears and your words start to flow naturally.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But here's the exciting part.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Repetition is just one piece of the puzzle.", "question": ""},
{"result":"In the next chapter, we'll talk about how to make practice fun.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You'll learn how to turn speaking English into something you look forward to every day instead of something that feels like hard work.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Chapter 4, Making Practice Fun.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Speaking English doesn't have to feel like a chore.", "question": ""},
{"result":"In fact, the more fun you have while practicing, the faster you'll improve.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When learning is enjoyable, you naturally want to do it more often.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This chapter is all about turning your English practice into something you look forward to every day.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Imagine this instead of forcing yourself to sit down and study.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You actually enjoy speaking English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's not about studying grammar rules or memorizing words.", "question": ""},
{"result":"It's about having fun and feeling excited to use what you've learned.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But how do you make practice fun?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let's explore a few techniques that will turn your speaking practice.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Into an activity you love.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One role-playing step into real conversations.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of the best ways to make speaking English fun is through role-playing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This is where you act out different situations as if you're really there.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can pretend to be ordering coffee at a cafe, having a job interview.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Meeting new friends at a party.", "question": ""},
{"result":"By role-playing, you're practicing real life conversations in a low pressure, enjoyable way.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's how you can start.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One, pick a situation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Think of a common scenario where you might need to speak English, like asking for directions or ordering food.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Two, create a dialogue.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Write down a few sentences that you might need to say in that situation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Three, act it out.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Do this alone or with a friend.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Pretend you're in the actual place and use the sentences you've prepared.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The great thing about role-playing is that it helps you get comfortable with everyday phrases and situations.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Plus it feels more like.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Acting than studying, so it's much more enjoyable.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of my students, Anna, used to feel bored practicing English by herself.", "question": ""},
{"result":"I introduced her to role-playing, and suddenly her practice sessions became more exciting.", "question": ""},
{"result":"She would imagine herself traveling, ordering food, and meeting new people, all while practicing English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Overtime, her speaking skills improved and she didn't even realize she was studying.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Two, talk about what you love.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Another way to make practice fun is by talking about your passions.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Think about something you love, whether it's a hobby, a sport, a favorite movie, or a book.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you talk about things that interest you.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The words come more easily, and you're more motivated to keep speaking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"For example, if you love cooking, try talking about your favorite recipes in English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Describe how to make your favorite dish, or pretend you're teaching someone how to cook.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The key is to pick a topic that excites you so you'll feel more engaged while practicing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Here's a great quote by Albert Einstein.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Creativity is intelligence having fun.", "question": ""},
{"result":"When you practice speaking about things you love, you're using your creativity, and that makes the process more enjoyable and effective.", "question": ""},
{"result":"3 Play speaking games.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Who said language learning can't be a game?", "question": ""},
{"result":"There are lots of speaking games you can play either by yourself or with a partner.", "question": ""},
{"result":"These games challenge you to think and speak in English, but in a fun and lighthearted way.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Practice with podcasts and stories.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Another way to keep practice fun is by using podcasts and stories.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Listening to stories and podcasts not only improves your listening skills, but it also gives you great material to talk about.", "question": ""},
{"result":"After listening, try summarizing the story in your own words or discuss it with a friend.", "question": ""},
{"result":"You can find many great stories and podcasts on my YouTube channel, designed to help learners like you improve their English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Choose a topic that interests you, listen to the story, and then practice speaking about it.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This way, you're learning from engaging content while practicing your speaking skills.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of my students, Tom, struggled with staying motivated to practice speaking, but once he started listening to podcasts about his favorite topics.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Like technology and travel, he found that speaking about them came naturally.", "question": ""},
{"result":"He would listen to an episode, then practice explaining it to himself or others, making his practice both effective and enjoyable.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Change your environment.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Sometimes a change in your environment can make practice more exciting.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Instead of sitting at a desk, try practicing in different places.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Go for a walk and describe what you see in English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Sit in a cafe and pretend you're having a conversation with the barista.", "question": ""},

{"result":"Did you successfully role play a conversation?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Celebrate that.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Recognizing your progress is a great way to stay motivated and keep practicing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"A famous quote by BF Skinner says a person who feels appreciated will always do more than what is expected.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This applies to yourself as well.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The more you appreciate your own progress, the more motivated you'll be to keep improving.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Now you might be thinking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"This all sounds great, but what if I hit a wall?", "question": ""},
{"result":"What if I feel stuck?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Don't worry, that's completely normal.", "question": ""},
{"result":"In the next chapter, we'll talk about breaking through those speaking blocks and how to keep moving forward even when it feels tough.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Chapter 5, Breaking Through Speaking Blocks.", "question": ""},
{"result":"So far you've learned how to make English practice fun with role-playing, speaking games, and podcasts.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But what happens when you feel stuck, when the words just don't come out and you're afraid of making mistakes?", "question": ""},
{"result":"These speaking blocks are normal and every learner experiences them.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The key is to understand how to break through them.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let's start by recognizing one thing.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Making mistakes is part of the learning process.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One of the biggest reasons people feel blocked is the fear of saying something wrong.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But here's a secret.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Even native speakers make mistakes.", "question": ""},
{"result":"What matters is that you keep speaking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The more you speak, the more confident you'll become, and the easier it will be to push through those blocks.", "question": ""},
{"result":"One overcome the fear of mistakes.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Imagine you're having a conversation and suddenly you forget a word or say something wrong.", "question": ""},
{"result":"What do you do?", "question": ""},
{"result":"Most people freeze up or stop speaking entirely.", "question": ""},
{"result":"But here's what you should do instead.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Keep talking.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Don't worry about getting every word right.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Just focus on communicating your message.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Describe the word in another way.", "question": ""},
{"result":"If you can't remember a word, explain it using different words.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Stay in the conversation.", "question": ""},
{"result":"The important thing is to keep going.", "question": ""},
{"result":"Let me tell you about one of my students, Daniel.", "question": ""},
{"result":"He was so worried about making mistakes that he would freeze whenever he tried to speak English.", "question": ""},
{"result":"I told him that mistakes are not failures, they're opportunities to learn.", "question": ""},
